Organize your Node project like a pro. Right out of the gate N.B. gets a [metric] ton of boilerplate taken care of: clustering, Docker-support, error-handling, code modularity, logging, views, environments â€“ you name it. And all of that without having to deal with a heavy or an opinionated framework!

NodeBootstrap is a project skeleton for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)/[Express.js](http://expressjs.com)
development. It captures common best-practices, used by Node community, for project layout and setup configuration.

For demonstration purposes NodeBootstrap also packs Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
framework and shows how to manage Mustache/Handlebars-based view. It's not a mandatory part of the project.
NodeBootstrap is often used for web API projects, where there is no human-centric UI.
