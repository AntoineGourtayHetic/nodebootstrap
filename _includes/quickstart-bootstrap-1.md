### Bootstrapping New Project

Assuming you already have node and npm installed (if not: we recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)), you can install nodebootstrap via NPM
and use the nodebootstrap CLI tool to create a brand-new skeleton project.

You can replace `hello` in the installation command, with a sensible name for
your project. Once the new project is built (typically takes less than a
minute), you need to start it via a bash script. When the application finishes
start you should see a simple "home document" response at:
`http://localhost:3000/`
